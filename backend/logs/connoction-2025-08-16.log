I'm also grateful for our recent class of graduates, some of whom have already gone on to become Ambassadors (full circle!!!) I'm feeling proud of the team that helped bring this program to new geo's this summer, ensuring we reached students far and wide. who built new processes, resources, + infrastructure to support our growing community, who fully localized in Korea + Japan, helped review each and every application (and there were thousands!), and wrapped up a wild 10 global onboarding sessions last week! and I'm feeling energized by the passion and ingenuity of our incoming CL's (hi you all!!) they hail from 50+ countries around the world - they're designers and writers, engineers and marketers, entrepreneurs and doctors, scientists and dreamers. what stood out most this year about all of you, was your desire to make lasting impact on your campus communities with a little tool called Notion the next generation of toolmakers right here; and they're brilliant. let's do it, squad! 🖤✨🥰 368 30 comments Post Post Campus Leaders - rallied by the lovely Isabella R. - creating a 💌 Valentine's Day Love Notes board 💌, me expecting to read odes to their favourite Notion blocks and use-cases, and then being surprised with THIS is really everything you need to know about the Notion community. kindest. community. on. the. internet.

I work in community because I'm fueled by joy. there's a special type of joy that comes from empowering + connecting humans around a shared passion....and if you think about it, at its core, passion is fueled by joy too. I feel very lucky to get to build a career in something that aligns with my being and what I value - I know how rare that is, and I don't take it for granted the tl;dr before I get into it is that the Notion Community is absolutely unreal - there's nothing like it - millions of members, from almost every country in the world, with the kindest and most helpful disposition, tied together by something greater than a tool a few things that I'll remember my first year by: - 💞 all of the meaningful relationships built with community members around the globe - over video calls, meals, pop-up's, and gatherings - and the stories they've shared with me about their lives + dreams (if we crossed paths this year, know that I am endlessly grateful) - 🍎 launching Notion Campus Leaders and designing a program that inspires + educates the next gen of toolmakers (to the first 3 cohorts of CL's - you know who you are - I'm so proud of what we're building!!) - 🏡 starting to build a new home for the Notion Community by leading our community migration from Slack to Circle - ⚡ lighting up LATAM: celebrating Notion in español + portugês with a two-month-long Ambassador-led event series from Bogotá to Madrid, São Paulo to Lima and everywhere in between - 🖇 weaving community through all parts of Notion's business, from brand campaigns to product launches - some favourites: a community space for template creators that accompanied the new Template Gallery, this fall's Notion's Declassified School Survival Guide (authored almost entirely by our CL's!), and WHM collabs between community members and our Women in Tech affinity group - 👩🏽\u200d🎨 the people I work with at Notion are masters of their craft - I'm constantly in awe and constantly learning from each of them / we also care about each other as humans + do a lot of laughing together and that, I believe, is equally as important and of course, getting to jam every single day with my partners-in-community Francisco Cruz-Mendoza and Ben Lang , who make my weeks brighter + a whole lot of fun 💌 cheers to making more magic in year ✌🏽! hashtag lifeatnotion 202 21 comments Activity Activity 5,523 followers 5,523 followers Following Posts Comments Images Loaded 9 Posts posts Emma Yee Yick Emma Yee Yick • 1st Verified • 1st building community @ Notion building community @ Notion 1d • Edited • 1 day ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn are you a Notion super fan + power user who wants to join us at Make with Notion next month?

Had a lovely meal this week with my lovely Scotland crew. Looking forward to the next one! Faisa Mohamed Faisa Mohamed • 2nd Verified • 2nd Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion I’ve had the joy of hosting/supporting our quarterly Notion Ambassador Dinners in both London and Edinburgh this week. These gatherings are a small gesture of appreciation for all the brilliant energy and care our ambassadors bring to the community. But more than that, they’re a reminder of how important it is to create space beyond structured events. There’s something special about sitting around a table together. Conversations flow more naturally, ideas are shared more openly, and connections deepen in a way that feels easy and genuine. In product communities, it’s often the tool that brings people together but it’s connection that unlocks collaboration. It’s through getting to know one another, finding shared experiences, and building trust that ideas start to form and partnerships take shape. As the Notion community continues to grow across the UK, I’m really looking forward to creating more of these moments. Slower, more intentional spaces where relationships can be built over food, laughter and shared purpose. Here’s to more of that. hashtag Community hashtag CommunityBuilding hashtag NotionAmbassadors hashtag Notion hashtag NotionUK hashtag London hashtag Edinburgh …more Activate to view larger image, 1/2 Activate to view larger image, 1 comment 1 repost Show all posts Experience Experience Notion Notion Full-time · 3 yrs 1 mo Full-time · 3 yrs 1 mo New York, New York, United States New York, New York, United States Global Community Lead Global Community Lead Aug 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 1 mo Aug 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 1 mo currently leading community engagement: connecting the dots between our incredible members and product launches + brand moments, and building our community experience strategy! a handful of other projects I've worked on: launching and scaling our student leader community, activating members in localization pushes across the world, fueling our community-led motion, empowering members to host gatherings and build their local communities, designing engaging, intentional programming + content that deliver unique value to differing member personas currently leading community engagement: connecting the dots between our incredible members and product launches + brand moments, and building our community experience strategy! a handful of other projects I've worked on: launching and scaling our student leader community, activating members in localization pushes across the world, fueling our community-led motion, empowering members to host gatherings and build their local communities, designing engaging, intentional programming + content that deliver unique value to differing member personas Community Strategy, Community Engagement and +5 skills Notion CDMX Celebración y Meetup Notion CDMX Celebración y Meetup Community Manager Community Manager Aug 2022 - Aug 2023 · 1 yr 1 mo Aug 2022 to Aug 2023 · 1 yr 1 mo founding member of Notion's community team, designing programs + strategies that empower a global community of over 1.5 million toolmakers, creators, connectors, and educators to share, teach, and build founding member of Notion's community team, designing programs + strategies that empower a global community of over 1.5 million toolmakers, creators, connectors, and educators to share, teach, and build Program Management, Relationship Building and +5 skills Shef Shef Full-time · 2 yrs 8 mos Full-time · 2 yrs 8 mos Senior Manager, Community Senior Manager, Community 2021 - Aug 2022 · 1 yr 8 mos 2021 to Aug 2022 · 1 yr 8 mos one of the first ten employees at Shef, building community from the ground up in service of our mission to enable anyone to make a meaningful income and feed their neighbors one of the first ten employees at Shef, building community from the ground up in service of our mission to enable anyone to make a meaningful income and feed their neighbors Relationship Building, Community Management and +3 skills Team Manager, Community Experience Team Manager, Community Experience 2020 - 2021 · 1 yr 2020 to 2021 · 1 yr Program Management, Relationship Building and +4 skills The Power of a Homemade Meal The Power of a Homemade Meal At Shef, we’re rebuilding the food system from scratch, redefining who can participate in the food economy, and returning personal connection to the making, eating, and sharing of food.

I'm also grateful for our recent class of graduates, some of whom have already gone on to become Ambassadors (full circle!!!) I'm feeling proud of the team that helped bring this program to new geo's this summer, ensuring we reached students far and wide. who built new processes, resources, + infrastructure to support our growing community, who fully localized in Korea + Japan, helped review each and every application (and there were thousands!), and wrapped up a wild 10 global onboarding sessions last week! and I'm feeling energized by the passion and ingenuity of our incoming CL's (hi you all!!) they hail from 50+ countries around the world - they're designers and writers, engineers and marketers, entrepreneurs and doctors, scientists and dreamers. what stood out most this year about all of you, was your desire to make lasting impact on your campus communities with a little tool called Notion the next generation of toolmakers right here; and they're brilliant. let's do it, squad! 🖤✨🥰 368 30 comments Post Post Campus Leaders - rallied by the lovely Isabella R. - creating a 💌 Valentine's Day Love Notes board 💌, me expecting to read odes to their favourite Notion blocks and use-cases, and then being surprised with THIS is really everything you need to know about the Notion community. kindest. community. on. the. internet.

I work in community because I'm fueled by joy. there's a special type of joy that comes from empowering + connecting humans around a shared passion....and if you think about it, at its core, passion is fueled by joy too. I feel very lucky to get to build a career in something that aligns with my being and what I value - I know how rare that is, and I don't take it for granted the tl;dr before I get into it is that the Notion Community is absolutely unreal - there's nothing like it - millions of members, from almost every country in the world, with the kindest and most helpful disposition, tied together by something greater than a tool a few things that I'll remember my first year by: - 💞 all of the meaningful relationships built with community members around the globe - over video calls, meals, pop-up's, and gatherings - and the stories they've shared with me about their lives + dreams (if we crossed paths this year, know that I am endlessly grateful) - 🍎 launching Notion Campus Leaders and designing a program that inspires + educates the next gen of toolmakers (to the first 3 cohorts of CL's - you know who you are - I'm so proud of what we're building!!) - 🏡 starting to build a new home for the Notion Community by leading our community migration from Slack to Circle - ⚡ lighting up LATAM: celebrating Notion in español + portugês with a two-month-long Ambassador-led event series from Bogotá to Madrid, São Paulo to Lima and everywhere in between - 🖇 weaving community through all parts of Notion's business, from brand campaigns to product launches - some favourites: a community space for template creators that accompanied the new Template Gallery, this fall's Notion's Declassified School Survival Guide (authored almost entirely by our CL's!), and WHM collabs between community members and our Women in Tech affinity group - 👩🏽\u200d🎨 the people I work with at Notion are masters of their craft - I'm constantly in awe and constantly learning from each of them / we also care about each other as humans + do a lot of laughing together and that, I believe, is equally as important and of course, getting to jam every single day with my partners-in-community Francisco Cruz-Mendoza and Ben Lang , who make my weeks brighter + a whole lot of fun 💌 cheers to making more magic in year ✌🏽! hashtag lifeatnotion 202 21 comments Activity Activity 5,523 followers 5,523 followers Following Posts Comments Images Loaded 9 Posts posts Emma Yee Yick Emma Yee Yick • 1st Verified • 1st building community @ Notion building community @ Notion 1d • Edited • 1 day ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn are you a Notion super fan + power user who wants to join us at Make with Notion next month?

Had a lovely meal this week with my lovely Scotland crew. Looking forward to the next one! Faisa Mohamed Faisa Mohamed • 2nd Verified • 2nd Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion I’ve had the joy of hosting/supporting our quarterly Notion Ambassador Dinners in both London and Edinburgh this week. These gatherings are a small gesture of appreciation for all the brilliant energy and care our ambassadors bring to the community. But more than that, they’re a reminder of how important it is to create space beyond structured events. There’s something special about sitting around a table together. Conversations flow more naturally, ideas are shared more openly, and connections deepen in a way that feels easy and genuine. In product communities, it’s often the tool that brings people together but it’s connection that unlocks collaboration. It’s through getting to know one another, finding shared experiences, and building trust that ideas start to form and partnerships take shape. As the Notion community continues to grow across the UK, I’m really looking forward to creating more of these moments. Slower, more intentional spaces where relationships can be built over food, laughter and shared purpose.

Faisa Mohamed Faisa Mohamed • 2nd Verified • 2nd Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion I’ve had the joy of hosting/supporting our quarterly Notion Ambassador Dinners in both London and Edinburgh this week. These gatherings are a small gesture of appreciation for all the brilliant energy and care our ambassadors bring to the community. But more than that, they’re a reminder of how important it is to create space beyond structured events. There’s something special about sitting around a table together. Conversations flow more naturally, ideas are shared more openly, and connections deepen in a way that feels easy and genuine. In product communities, it’s often the tool that brings people together but it’s connection that unlocks collaboration. It’s through getting to know one another, finding shared experiences, and building trust that ideas start to form and partnerships take shape. As the Notion community continues to grow across the UK, I’m really looking forward to creating more of these moments. Slower, more intentional spaces where relationships can be built over food, laughter and shared purpose.

Faisa Mohamed Faisa Mohamed • 2nd Verified • 2nd Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion I’ve had the joy of hosting/supporting our quarterly Notion Ambassador Dinners in both London and Edinburgh this week. These gatherings are a small gesture of appreciation for all the brilliant energy and care our ambassadors bring to the community. But more than that, they’re a reminder of how important it is to create space beyond structured events. There’s something special about sitting around a table together. Conversations flow more naturally, ideas are shared more openly, and connections deepen in a way that feels easy and genuine. In product communities, it’s often the tool that brings people together but it’s connection that unlocks collaboration. It’s through getting to know one another, finding shared experiences, and building trust that ideas start to form and partnerships take shape. As the Notion community continues to grow across the UK, I’m really looking forward to creating more of these moments. Slower, more intentional spaces where relationships can be built over food, laughter and shared purpose.

Faisa Mohamed Faisa Mohamed • 2nd Verified • 2nd Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion Co-Founder Somalis in Tech | Community Program Manager @ Notion I’ve had the joy of hosting/supporting our quarterly Notion Ambassador Dinners in both London and Edinburgh this week. These gatherings are a small gesture of appreciation for all the brilliant energy and care our ambassadors bring to the community. But more than that, they’re a reminder of how important it is to create space beyond structured events. There’s something special about sitting around a table together. Conversations flow more naturally, ideas are shared more openly, and connections deepen in a way that feels easy and genuine. In product communities, it’s often the tool that brings people together but it’s connection that unlocks collaboration. It’s through getting to know one another, finding shared experiences, and building trust that ideas start to form and partnerships take shape. As the Notion community continues to grow across the UK, I’m really looking forward to creating more of these moments. Slower, more intentional spaces where relationships can be built over food, laughter and shared purpose.
